A command for MCGalaxy which rolls a dice (NOT A PLUGIN.)

Ok so put this file inside the folder ```extras/commands/source``` and use the command ```/compile DiceRoll``` then type ```/cmdload DiceRoll``` and the command info will be printed by typing ```/help DiceRoll```
And you can't really grab it from releases you have to compile it yourself!
